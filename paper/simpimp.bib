Speakers asked the listener for the cake mix in the presence of two cake mixes, one closer to the speaker and one closer to the listener. Listeners looked more at the cake mix closer to the speaker than the one closer to them when the speaker's hands were full than when the speaker's hands were empty. This difference was found in a measure of the first look, suggesting an immediate effect of perspective taking.

Evidence is presented that this interference reflects limitations in lexical processing. In three experiments, listeners' eye movements were monitored as they searched for the target of a speaker's referring expression in a display that also contained a phonological competitor (e.g., bucket/buckle). Listeners anticipated that the speaker would refer to something in common ground, but they did not experience less interference from a competitor in privileged ground than from a matched competitor in common ground. In contrast, interference from the competitor was eliminated when it was ruled out by a semantic constraint. These findings support a view of comprehension as relying on multiple systems with distinct access to information and present a challenge for constraint-based views of common ground.},

	Abstract = {Recent investigations of the acquisition of scalar implicature report that young children do not reliably reject a sentence with a weak scalar term, e.g. `some of the books are red', when it is used as a description of a situation where a stronger statement is true, e.g. where all the books are red. This is taken as evidence that children do not interpret the sentence with the implicature that the stronger statement does not hold. We propose that (a) these tasks cannot differentiate between actual implicature derivation and mere sensitivity to violations of informativeness; and that (b) children's apparent failure is not due to lack of competence (whether with informativeness or implicature) but due to their tolerance of pragmatic violations. We report three studies with 5-to-6-year-old English-speaking children and adults employing utterances involving scalar and non-scalar expressions. These show that both age-groups are competent with informativeness, but also tolerant of pragmatic infelicity. These findings have implications for the well-established literature on whether children are aware of ambiguity in referential communication tasks.

Strong implicature is generated automatically upon encountering a weak expression regardless of the context

Q-heuristic: "what isn't said isn't (the case)."
(based on Grice 1989: Maxim of quantity "Make your utterance as informative as is required")

"While generalized conversational implicatures arise effortlessly, by default, and across contexts, their particularized cousins are relative to the occurrent context. Whether a particularized conversational implicature arises depends on some unspecified maxim of relevance which is responsive to contextual circumstances.

In contrast to Chierchia's structural Default view, Levinson proposes a pragmatic Default view. 

Although Chierchia's and Levinson's accounts of scalar implicatures differ in that Chier- chia provides a mainly grammatical account of scalar implicatures, while Levinson's account is a pragmatic one, both share the core idea that scalar implicatures arise per default, independently of context; cancellation occurs in an additional, effortful step."

	Abstract = {Recent research on children's inferencing has found that although adults typically adopt the pragmatic interpretation of some (implying not all), 5- to 9-year-olds often prefer the semantic interpretation of the quantifier (meaning possibly all). Do these failures reflect a breakdown of pragmatic competence or the metalinguistic demands of prior tasks? In 3 experiments, the authors used the visual-world eye-tracking paradigm to elicit an implicit measure of adults' and children's abilities to generate scalar implicatures. Although adults' eye-movements indicated that adults had interpreted some with the pragmatic inference, children's looks suggested that children persistently interpreted some as compatible with all (Experiment 1). Nevertheless, both adults and children were able to quickly reject competitors that were inconsistent with the semantics of some; this confirmed the sensitivity of the paradigm (Experiment 2). Finally, adults, but not children, successfully distinguished between situations that violated the scalar implicature and those that did not (Experiment 3). These data demonstrate that children interpret quantifiers on the basis of their semantic content and fail to generate scalar implicatures during online language comprehension.},

Rational speech-act theory: listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to ``invert'' this model of the speaker

Model: depends on shared knowledge about the aspects of the world to which the speaker has access

Argument: the speaker's access affects utterance interpretation

Experiment 1: `some'; Experiment 2: number
(e.g., Laura saw 2 of 3 letters, she says some of the letters have checks in them)

Model successfully:
- Predicted standard implicatures as an inference that depends on alternative utterances
- Predicted that these implicatures could be canceled when it was common knowledge that the speaker had incomplete knowledge

	Abstract = {Adult humans recognize that even unfamiliar speech can communicate information between third parties, demonstrating an ability to separate communicative function from linguistic content. We examined whether 12-month-old infants understand that speech can communicate before they understand the meanings of specific words. Specifically, we test the understanding that speech permits the transfer of information about a Communicator's target object to a Recipient. Initially, the Communicator selectively grasped one of two objects. In test, the Communicator could no longer reach the objects. She then turned to the Recipient and produced speech (a nonsense word) or non-speech (coughing). 

Infants looked longer when the Recipient selected the non-target than the target object when the Communicator had produced speech but not coughing (Experiment 1). 

Looking time patterns differed from the speech condition when the Recipient rather than the Communicator produced the speech (Experiment 2), 

and when the Communicator produced a positive emotional vocalization (Experiment 3), but did not differ when the Recipient had previously received information about the target by watching the Communicator's selective grasping (Experiment 4). Thus infants understand the information-transferring properties of speech and recognize some of the conditions under which others' information states can be updated. These results suggest that infants possess an abstract understanding of the communicative function of speech, providing an important potential mechanism for language and knowledge acquisition.},

	Abstract = {When faced with a sentence like, ``Some of the toys are on the table'', adults, but not preschoolers, compute a scalar implicature, taking the sentence to imply that not all the toys are on the table. This paper explores the hypothesis that children fail to compute scalar implicatures because they lack knowledge of relevant scalar alternatives to words like ``some''. Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which three out of three objects fit a description (e.g., three animals reading), and were asked to evaluate statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g., knowing that all is an alternative to some for the utterance ``Some of the animals are reading'') or contextual alternatives (e.g., knowing that the set of all three visible animals is an alternative to a set of two for the utterance ``Onlythe cat and the dog are reading''). Children failed to reject the false statements containing context-independent scales even when the word only was used (e.g., only some), but correctly rejected equivalent statements containing contextual alternatives (e.g., only the cat and dog). These results support the hypothesis that children's difficulties with scalar implicature are due to a failure to generate relevant alternatives for specific scales. Consequences for number word learning are also discussed.},
	Annote = {Summary:
Why are children bad at implicatures? It's because they lack scalar alternatives.


4 steps of deriving implicature:

I. Compute basic meaning of a sentence S containing L, a scalar item.
II. Generate a set of alternatives (a1, a2, . . . , an) to S, called Salt. These are all the sentences that can be generated by replacing L with its scalar alternatives.
III. Restrict the alternatives in Salt by removing any alternative that is entailed by the original utterance S. Call this restricted set S*.
IV. Strengthen the basic meaning of S (containing L) with the negation of all of the members of S*.},

	Abstract = {Inferring what speakers mean from what they say requires consideration of what they know. For instance, depending on the speaker's level of expertise, uttering Some squirrels hibernate can imply that not all squirrels hibernate, or it might imply the weaker proposition that the speaker does not know whether all squirrels hibernate. The present study examines the extent to which speaker knowledge influences implied meanings as well as the timing of any such influence. Using a self-paced presentation, participants read sentences containing some in contexts where a speaker should know whether all was true, or where the speaker merely might know whether all was true. This knowledge manipulation was found to have immediate and reliable effects on the type of inference that was drawn. In contrast, knowledge played no role when the same meanings were conveyed literally. This work thus demonstrates that perceivers consider the speaker's knowledge state incrementally to establish the speaker's communicative goals. },

Method:
Subject reads:
(complete) "I carefully read the document. Some of the investments lost money. The rest were successful"
(incomplete) "I skimmed the document. Some of the investments lost money. The rest were successful"

Results:
On "some": complete subjects were slow, incomplete subjects were fast
On "the rest": complete were fast, incomplete were slow

	Abstract = {Linguistic communication relies on pragmatic implicatures such as the inference that if ``some students passed the test,'' not all did. Yet young children perform poorly on tests of implicature, especially scalar implicatures using ``some'' and ``all,'' until quite late in development. We investigate the ori- gins of scalar implicature using tasks in which the scale arises from real-world context rather than conventional contrasts be- tween lexical items. Experiment 1 shows that these ad-hoc implicatures are easy for preschool children, suggesting that children have an early competence at pragmatic inference, and that failures in standard scalar implicature tasks are due in- stead to problems contrasting lexical items. Experiments 2 and 3 compare a Gricean, counterfactual account of implica- ture with a linguistic alternatives account and find that neither predicts effects of contextual informativeness. We conclude that an account of pragmatic implicature must integrate world knowledge, linguistic structure, and social reasoning.},

@article{bott2004,
	Abstract = {When Tarzan asks Jane Do you like my friends? and Jane answers Some of them, her underinformative reply implicates Not all of them. This scalar inference arises when a less-than-maximally informative utterance implies the denial of a more informative proposition. Default Inference accounts (e.g., Levinson, 1983 and Levinson, 2000) argue that this inference is linked to lexical items (e.g., some) and is generated automatically and largely independently of context. Alternatively, Relevance theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1985/1995) treats such inferences as contextual and as arriving effortfully with deeper processing of utterances. We compare these accounts in four experiments that employ a sentence verification paradigm. We focus on underinformative sentences, such as Some elephants are mammals, because these are false with a scalar inference and true without it. Experiment 1 shows that participants are less accurate and take significantly longer to answer correctly when instructions call for a Some but not all interpretation rather than a Some and possibly all interpretation. Experiment 2, which modified the paradigm of Experiment 1 so that correct responses to both interpretations resulted in the same overt response, reports results that confirm those of the first Experiment. Experiment 3, which imposed no interpretations, reveals that those who employed a Some but not all reading to the underinformative items took longest to respond. Experiment 4 shows that the rate of scalar inferences increased as permitted response time did. These results argue against a Neo-Gricean account and in favor of Relevance theory.},

Addressees were sensitive to this tendency, and quickly directed attention toward private entities when interpreting these questions. A second experiment replicated the interpretation findings in a more constrained setting. These results add to previous evidence that the common ground influences initial language processes, and suggests that the strength and polarity of common ground effects may depend on contributions of sentence type as well as the interactivity of the situation.},

	Abstract = {We explored children's early interpretation of numerals and linguistic number marking, in order to test the hypothesis (e.g., Carey (2004). Bootstrapping and the origin of concepts. Daedalus, 59--68) that children's initial distinction between one and other numerals (i.e., two, three, etc.) is bootstrapped from a prior distinction between singular and plural nouns. Previous studies have presented evidence that in languages without singular--plural morphology, like Japanese and Chinese, children acquire the meaning of the word one later than in singular--plural languages like English and Russian. In two experiments, we sought to corroborate this relation between grammatical number and integer acquisition within English. We found a significant correlation between children's comprehension of numerals and a large set of natural language quantifiers and determiners, even when controlling for effects due to age. However, we also found that 2-year-old children, who are just acquiring singular--plural morphology and the word one, fail to assign an exact interpretation to singular noun phrases (e.g., a banana), despite interpreting one as exact. For example, in a Truth-Value Judgment task, most children judged that a banana was consistent with a set of two objects, despite rejecting sets of two for the numeral one. Also, children who gave exactly one object for singular nouns did not have a better comprehension of numerals relative to children who did not give exactly one. Thus, we conclude that the correlation between quantifier comprehension and numeral comprehension in children of this age is not attributable to the singular--plural distinction facilitating the acquisition of the word one. We argue that quantifiers play a more general role in highlighting the semantic function of numerals, and that children distinguish between numerals and other quantifiers from the beginning, assigning exact interpretations only to numerals.},
